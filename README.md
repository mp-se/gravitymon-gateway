# Gravitymon BLE Gateway

This project is a test to manage bluetooth data from Gravitymon 2.x version that contain more data than the Tilt protocol.

Its designed to run on top of the Tiltbride Hardware where the goal is to incorporate this into that project in the future.

Its not a replacement for Tiltbridge since this only focus on the GravityMon BLE data formats. The intention is to integrate this
feature with Tiltbridge in the future. 

There is not yet any documentation for this project.
